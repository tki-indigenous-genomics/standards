# Privacy and security

## Preserving participant anonymity

### Participant identifiers

## Data encryption

When thinking about data encryption, we consider three three main scenarios:  

1. **Encrypting data at rest** refers to the encryption of data while it's stored on whatever file storage you use.  
2. **Encrypting data in transit** refers to encrypting data while it travels through private or public networks.  
3. **Encrypting data in use** refers to the maintenance of encryption while the data is actively being used in RAM or CPU.

### Encryption at rest
Data that has the ability to identify participants, such as sequence data and variant calls should be encrypted-at-rest. 


## Server and database authentication
