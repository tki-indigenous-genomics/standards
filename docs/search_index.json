Our goal is to collect, curate and assemble robust datasets that encompass critical aspects of Indigenous Australian health to ensure equitable outcomes in precision medicine are possible. This includes biological, cultural and socioeconomic data to investigate health outcomes that will deliver meaningful benefit to Indigenous Australians. However, with big data also come significant responsibilities concerning data storage, sovereignty and accessibility. Large collections of data on Indigenous Australians require carefully considered data architecture that maintains sovereignty based on community-defined priorities, protocols, and agreements, with concomitant attendance to matters of accountability and building trust. Here we outline TKI Indigenous Genomics groups standards for data storage, access and sharing. The goal of these data standards is to document the policies, rules, and standards governing how data are stored, secured, arranged, integrated, and used in analyses and reporting. These standards are being developed in consultation with Indigenous Communities. Where possible, these standards will also align with the The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health GA4GH standards. A well-considered approach to data architecture is critical given the national importance of Indigenous genomics data security. 1.1 Structure of this book "],["data-descriptors-definitions.html", "Chapter 2 Data descriptors &amp; definitions 2.1 Describing primary data file types 2.2 File type descriptors 2.3 Example", " Chapter 2 Data descriptors &amp; definitions This page provides definitions and guidance on the information that should be recorded for primary data files. Data that is clearly, simply and consistently described (named and defined) is much easier for users to identify, understand, use and share the data. This also ensures consistency across projects, inter-operability and is complementary to reproducible research practices. 2.1 Describing primary data file types Biological data continue to be produced from an extensive array of assays and technologies. These data are often represented in unique file types and processed by specific software and algorithms. Below are descriptors that should be used for each file type. 2.2 File type descriptors File type: This is the file format to be typically denoted by the file extension. Description: A brief description of the file format. Compression: The algorithm and/or method used to compress the file. Permissions: These are the user permission profiles for the groups and users that have access to the data, and the level of access Category 1: (Highest): Lead PI (Alex Brown) and Chief Data Scientist (Jimmy Breen) Category 2: Lead PI, Chief Data Scientist and Data Science team Category 3: Lead PI, Chief Data Scientist, Data Science team and TKI IT Team Category 4: (Lowest): Public Access frequency: How often this data type may require access. These descriptions are based on a subset of the Google Cloud storage class descriptors. Standard: Standard Storage is for data that is frequently accessed and/or stored for only brief periods of time. Standard data files should be able to be regenerated from Nearline or Archive data files without too much time or effort. Nearline: Nearline Storage is ideal for data you plan to read or modify on average once per month or less. Nearline Storage is appropriate for data backup and short-term archiving. Archive: highly durable storage for data archiving, backup, and disaster recovery. Only used for infrequently accessed data. Community access: Are their community custodians for these data? If so, who are they? Identifiable: Could this data be used to identify an individual (YES/NO). Location: Location(s) where the data should be stored. Notes: Any additional information that would assist users of the data. Sample: A sample of the file data with descriptions of each field. Useful if this file type is not a widely used and documented standard. 2.3 Example For example, the description of CGmap file format for DNA methylation data would look like this: File type: CGmap Description: TSV file of stranded pileup base calls for cytosine positions in the reference genome DNA methylation data.

Here, the primary directory structure of raw and processed data, and any identifiable data that relates to a single individual will be stored in a directory structure with the individuals unique identifier as the higher level directory. In the event of a person requesting their data to be deleted, this should be possible by deleting the top level folder associated to their participant id. Below that, the data should be organised by assay type (wgs, DNAme, RNA-seq), and then the data types for each assay. ├── ID ├── readme.md ├── WGS ├── raw ├── aligned ├── DNAme ├── raw ├── aligned ├── RNA ├── raw ├── aligned For example, the directory structure for individual with the id BODLAXXRD might look like this. ├── data ├── BODLAXXRD ├── readme.md ├── WGS ├── raw ├── BODLAXXRD_wgs_unaligned_1.cram ├── aligned ├── BODLAXXRD_wgs_aligned.cram ├── processed ├── BODLAXXRD_wgs.vcf ├── DNAme ├── raw ├── BODLAXXRD_DNAme_unaligned.cram ├── aligned ├── BODLAXXRD_DNAme_aligned.cram ├── processed ├── BODLAXXRD_DNAme.ATCGmap.gz ├── BODLAXXRD_DNAme.CGmap.gz ├── RNA ├── raw ├── BODLAXXRD_RNA.cram ├── aligned ├── BODLAXXRD_RNA.cram 3.2 Participant README file lorem ipsum 3.3 File compression lorem ipsum 3.4 Checksums lorem ipsum 3.5 Date formats Use the format YYYYMMDD Use ISO 8601 formatted dates where date and time values are ordered from the largest to smallest unit of time: year, month (or week) and day, minute, second. These formats enable easy chronological sorting. For example, 5 Jan 2012 would be 20120105 3.6 Seperating elements in file names Use the underscore _ to separate elements in file names. This refers to the characters you will use to separate each piece of metadata in the file name. Many computer systems cannot handle spaces in file names, so NEVER use spaces! Dashes (-) or capitalising the first letter of each word (CammelCaps) is also often used, however to make things simple, we prefer the use of the underscore _.
